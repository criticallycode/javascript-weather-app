This repo demonstrates a simple weather app, getting data from OpenWeatherMap based off the user's GPS coordinates, obtained via browser. The app is created with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You'll need to ensure that location services are enabled in your browser to make use of the app. Thanks to [CodeExplained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8n8ftV94ZU_DJLOLtrpORA) for the basis for this app.
